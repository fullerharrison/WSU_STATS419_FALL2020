	abstract = {The study of elite basketball players’ anthropometric characteristics alongside those of body composition contributes significantly to their profiling as professional athletes and plays an important role in the selection process, as these characteristics can have a significant impact on performance. In the current study, 110 professional basketball players from a series of Spanish professional Leagues (ACB, LEB and EBA) and youth level National Teams (U20 and U18) had their anthropometric profiles measured and compared to determine differences between them. Furthermore, all 110 players were divided into three different categories according to their playing position: guards, forwards and centres. The results obtained show no significant differences between players in different competitions in weight, height and the sum of skinfolds. Nonetheless, there were several differences related to body fat content (13.03\% in ACB players and 10.52\% in the lower categories and National Teams). There were also several differences found between the different playing positions amongst all playing levels in body mass (79.56 ± 2.41, 91.04 ± 1.51 and 104.56 ± 1.73 kg), height (182.28 ± 0.96, 195.65 ± 1.00 and 204.08 ± 0.67 cm), skinfold distribution and perimeters. However, there were no significant differences in body fat content between the different playing positions. The conclusions obtained from this study provide a better understanding to basketball specialists regarding the selection process of players at the elite level, especially on the transition from youth elite programs to men’s elite leagues.},

Forty-eight males were enrolled in the study, divided into two groups: twenty-four senior players from the Super League and twenty-four senior players from the Second Basketball League of Serbia. Morphological characteristics were evaluated by a battery of four variables: body height, body weight, arm span and leg length. Body composition was evaluated by a battery of two variables: Body mass index and body fat percentage. The standard central and dispersive parameters of all variables were calculated. The significance of the differences between the basketball players from the Super League and the Second League of Serbia was determined by a t-test for small independent samples. The purpose of this study is to describe the anthropometric characteristics and body composition of the basketball players, as well as to determine possible differences in relation to the ranking of the competition. The results showed that a significant difference was found for five variables among the group: body height, body weight, arm span, leg length and body fat percentage, while the difference was not observed for body mass index. Therefore, these findings may give coaches knowledge that there are significant differences between teams in relation to the rankings of the competition.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether the limb length-to-body ratio in young basketball players (15-18 years) is different in comparison to those who do not play basketball, and to contribute to the hypothesis that those with which body type can be more successful in basketball. Material: The measurements were performed on 42 individuals (29 boys, 13 girls) who have played basketball for at least three years and 41 individuals (31 boys, 10 girls) who did not play basketball. A standard form was prepared for these measurements and the measurements were made according to this form. The data were summarized using mean and standard deviation values, and their accordance with normal distribution was evaluated with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The t-test was used for evaluating the independent samples. Values of p{\textless}0.05 were considered significant. The measurements were performed using a tape measure.
Results: As a result of the measurements, the height/fa (forearm) ratio was 7.09 in non-basketball players and 6.71 in basketball players. The height/hl (hand length) ratio was 10.0 in non-basketball players and 9.06 in basketball players. The height /lll (lower limb length) ratio was 1.86 in non-basketball players and 1.73 in basketball players. The height /tl (thigh length) ratio was 3.28 in non-basketball players and 3.41 in basketball players. According to our findings, the ratio of forearm, hand, thigh and leg to body were increased in basketball players. There was no significant difference in terms of gender.

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigated two questions: (1) can measurements of anthropometric and physiological attributes substitute for expert assessment of adolescent basketball players, and (2) how much does the quantitative assessment of a player vary among experts? The first question is relevant to the potential simplification of the player selection process. The second question pertains directly to the validity of expert quantitative assessment. Our research was based on data from 148 U14 female and male basketball players. For each player, an array of anthropometric and physiological attributes was recorded, including body height, body mass, BMI, and several motor skill tests. Furthermore, each player's current ability and potential ability were quantitatively evaluated by two different experts from a group of seven experts. Analysis of the recorded data showed that the anthropometric and physiological attributes explained between 15\% and 40\% of the variance in experts’ scores. The primary predictive attributes were speed and agility (for predicting current ability) and body height and growth potential (for predicting potential ability). We concluded that these attributes were not sufficiently informative to act as a substitute for expert assessment of the players’ current or potential ability. There is substantial variability in different experts' scores of the same player’s ability. However, the differences between experts are mostly in scale, and the relationships between experts’ scores are monotonic. That is, different experts rank players on ability very similarly, but their scores are not well calibrated.},

All players were tested in Podgorica, in lasting period of two days, while they held preparations for the European Championship, one month before the start of the Championship. Anthropometric characteristics in the body composition were evaluated by a battery of eleven variables: body height (cm), body weight (kg), triceps skinfold, back skinfold, biceps skinfold, abdominal skinfold, thighs skinfold, calf skinfold, body mass index (BMI), percentage of fat and muscle mass (kg). Differences in anthropometric characteristic and composition of the body of the female basketball players of two national teams, Ukraine and Montenegro, were determined by using a discriminatory parametric procedure with t-test for small independent samples. It was found that the basketball players of Montenegro are slightly lower and have more body mass. Also, there are significant statistical differences by 3 variables that estimate the abdominal skinfold, calf skinfold and fat percentage, in favor of the National team of Ukraine.},

	abstract = {Background: Determining somatic models and proﬁles in young athletes has recently become a fundamental element in selecting basketball playing positions. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the body build of young and adult elite male basketball players at different playing positions. Methods: Participants consisted of 35 young (age: 14.09 ± 0.30 years, n = 35) and 35 adult professional basketball players (age: 24.45 ± 5.40 years, n = 35) competing in elite leagues. The anthropometric characteristics assessed included body mass, body height, skinfolds, somatotypes, girths, and breadths. Results: The centers in both age groups were signiﬁcantly taller and heavier (p {\textless} 0.001) compared to forwards and guards. The greatest difference between categories were in the guards’ personal height (from 169.36 to 186.68 = 17.32 cm). The guards from the professional team were closest in height to the forwards (difference = 7.17 cm) compared to young players where the difference between guards and forwards was 13.23 cm. Young competitors were more ectomorphic (2.12-3.75-4.17), while professional players were more mesomorphic (2.26-4.57-3.04). Signiﬁcant criteria for center selection at professional level seems to be personal height and arm span ratio. Conclusions: The results indicate that the selection for basketball playing positions should include the analysis of body height and mass, shoulder breadth, humerus breadth, femur breadth and speciﬁcally for centers the difference between personal the height and arm span.},

abstract = {The aims of the present study were: a) to determine the anthropometric profile, body composition and somatotype of elite Greek female basketball (B), volleyball (V) and handball (H) players, b) to compare the mean scores among sports and c) to detect possible differences in relation to competition level.
A total of 518 female athletes, all members of the Greek first National League (A1 and A2 division) in B, V and H sport teams participated in the present study. Twelve anthropometric measures required for the calculation of body composition indexes and somatotype components were obtained according to the established literature.
V athletes were the tallest (P<0.001) among the three groups of athletes, had the lowest values of body fat (P<0.001) and their somatotype was characterized as balanced endomorph (3.4-2.7-2.9). B athletes were taller (P<0.01) and leaner (P<0.001) than H players, with a somatotype characterized as mesomorph-endomorph (3.7-3.2-2.4). H athletes were the shortest of all (P<0.01), had the highest percentage of body fat (P<0.001) and their somatotype was mesomorph-endomorph (4.2-4.7-1.8). In comparison with their A2 counterparts the A1 division players were taller (P<0.001) and heavier (P<0.01), but at the same time leaner (P<0.001), and exhibited higher homogeneity in somatotype characteristics (P<0.05).
Anthropometric, body composition and somatotype variables of Greek female elite teamball players varied among sports; selection criteria, hours of training and sport-specific physiological demands during the game could explain the observed differences. More data are certainly needed to define the anthropometric profile of B, V and H female athletes internationally.},
