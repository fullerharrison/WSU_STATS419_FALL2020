	abstract = {The study of elite basketball players’ anthropometric characteristics alongside those of body composition contributes significantly to their profiling as professional athletes and plays an important role in the selection process, as these characteristics can have a significant impact on performance. In the current study, 110 professional basketball players from a series of Spanish professional Leagues (ACB, LEB and EBA) and youth level National Teams (U20 and U18) had their anthropometric profiles measured and compared to determine differences between them. Furthermore, all 110 players were divided into three different categories according to their playing position: guards, forwards and centres. The results obtained show no significant differences between players in different competitions in weight, height and the sum of skinfolds. Nonetheless, there were several differences related to body fat content (13.03\% in ACB players and 10.52\% in the lower categories and National Teams). There were also several differences found between the different playing positions amongst all playing levels in body mass (79.56 ± 2.41, 91.04 ± 1.51 and 104.56 ± 1.73 kg), height (182.28 ± 0.96, 195.65 ± 1.00 and 204.08 ± 0.67 cm), skinfold distribution and perimeters. However, there were no significant differences in body fat content between the different playing positions. The conclusions obtained from this study provide a better understanding to basketball specialists regarding the selection process of players at the elite level, especially on the transition from youth elite programs to men’s elite leagues.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Previous studies have demonstrated the need for regionally specific stature estimation formulae due to the geographical specificity of limb proportionality related to the effects of environmental pressures on growth and development. High-altitude Andean populations have often been neglected in the creation of these formulae. This study uses a hybrid approach to create linear regression formulae for stature estimation and test their accuracy when compared previously published formulae traditionally used in Andean bioarchaeology.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to describe morphological characteristics and body composition of the basketball players from Super League and Second League of Serbia as well as to make comparison between them. Forty-eight males were enrolled in the study, divided into two groups: twenty-four senior players from the Super League and twenty-four senior players from the Second Basketball League of Serbia. Morphological characteristics were evaluated by a battery of four variables: body height, body weight, arm span and leg length. Body composition was evaluated by a battery of two variables: Body mass index and body fat percentage. The standard central and dispersive parameters of all variables were calculated. The significance of the differences between the basketball players from the Super League and the Second League of Serbia was determined by a t-test for small independent samples. The purpose of this study is to describe the anthropometric characteristics and body composition of the basketball players, as well as to determine possible differences in relation to the ranking of the competition. The results showed that a significant difference was found for five variables among the group: body height, body weight, arm span, leg length and body fat percentage, while the difference was not observed for body mass index. Therefore, these findings may give coaches knowledge that there are significant differences between teams in relation to the rankings of the competition.},
